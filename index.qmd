## Introduction

The rhythm of the human heart, far from being a simple, constant beat, is a complex and dynamic signal reflecting the continuous interplay between an organism and its internal and external environments. The precise timing between successive heartbeats, measured as the R-R interval (RRi), is a primary non-invasive proxy for autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity. The analysis of variations in this interval, a discipline known as heart rate variability (HRV), has become a cornerstone for assessing cardiovascular health, stress responses, and overall physiological state. This variability arises from the coordinated actions of multiple regulatory systems, including the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the ANS, baroreflexes, and thermoregulatory mechanisms.

Despite its utility, a significant limitation of traditional HRV analysis is its reliance on time-domain or frequency-domain metrics derived from static, short-term data windows. While such methods may offer insights into a snapshot of a physiological state under controlled conditions, they are fundamentally ill-suited to capture the dynamic, non-stationary nature of RRi signals during physiological transitions or stress, such as exercise, cognitive tasks, or pharmacologic interventions. The implicit assumption of stationarity in these fixed-window approaches can obscure subtle, yet physiologically critical, shifts in heart rate and its underlying variability. Furthermore, these conventional analyses often fail to establish a direct mechanistic link between observed changes in HRV and the underlying physiological processes responsible for them. For instance, a generalized decrease in HRV may be interpreted as a withdrawal of parasympathetic tone but could also stem from a complex shift in the balance of different frequency components of autonomic modulation. Disentangling these potential causes necessitates a more sophisticated, unified modeling paradigm.

Attempts to address these limitations have been made using a variety of modeling approaches, but these have often fallen short. For instance, state-space models have shown promise in tracking the evolution of cardiac dynamics, but their complexity can make parameter estimation difficult and their physiological interpretability limited. While time-frequency analysis methods, such as wavelets, can successfully visualize the time-varying nature of spectral content, they typically do not provide a generative model for testing specific physiological hypotheses. Moreover, they often lack a principled way to separate structured physiological variability from unstructured noise. Other efforts have focused on non-linear dynamics and fractal analysis, but these models are often phenomenological, describing the properties of the signal without offering a clear, mechanistic link to the underlying physiology. Consequently, no existing model provides a unified, probabilistic framework that can simultaneously capture and mechanistically interpret changes in both the mean RRi and its multi-component variability.

To advance the field beyond these constraints, a new generation of statistical models is clearly needed. These models must transcend simple descriptive statistics to provide a unified framework that simultaneously captures the time-varying nature of both the mean heart rate and the dynamic evolution of its multi-timescale variability. Such a framework should explicitly address the non-stationarity inherent to physiological signals, obviating the need for arbitrary, fixed-length analysis windows. It must be capable of decomposing the signal into its distinct components, separating the gross, underlying trends in heart rate from the structured, oscillatory variability that represents physiological regulation. Crucially, the model's parameters should have a direct, interpretable link to specific physiological processes, such as autonomic tone, sympathetic-parasympathetic balance, and the dynamics of recovery. As a probabilistic framework, it should also provide a principled means of quantifying the uncertainty associated with all parameter estimates, moving beyond a reliance on point estimates to offer a more complete picture of the physiological state.

This paper presents a novel probabilistic framework for analyzing non-stationary RRi signals. Our approach directly confronts these challenges by formulating the RRi signal as a continuous stochastic process. This model decomposes the signal into a deterministic mean trajectory and a time-varying total standard deviation, both of which are constructed mechanistically. The model's key innovations include a mechanistic model for the mean RRi that uses a flexible double-logistic function to allow for the direct estimation of physiologically salient parameters, such as the magnitude of heart rate change and the timing of response and recovery. A core innovation is the explicit decomposition of the total signal variance into components representing structured, oscillatory variability and unstructured, residual noise, which is critical for understanding the sources of change in HRV. We generalize the traditional SDNN metric into a time-varying trajectory, which is also modeled using a logistic function analogous to that for the mean RRi, thereby capturing the dynamic suppression and recovery of total variability in a parsimonious manner. A crucial mathematical inversion within the framework ensures that the amplitude of the synthesized structured signal exactly matches the target SDNN trajectory at every time point, effectively decoupling the total magnitude of variability from its spectral composition and enabling more granular analysis. Finally, the model captures the dynamic allocation of power across different physiological frequency bands by modeling their proportions as a function of a smooth master controller, which allows for a detailed analysis of shifts in spectral balance during physiological transitions.

The primary objective of this study is to introduce and validate this novel probabilistic model for the analysis of non-stationary RRi signals. We aim to demonstrate that this framework provides a more robust, informative, and physiologically interpretable analysis of heart rate dynamics than traditional methods. We hypothesize that the model will accurately and robustly capture the complex, time-varying dynamics of both the mean RRi and its variability during transient physiological perturbations. We further propose that the model's parameters will yield enhanced mechanistic insights into autonomic control and cardiovascular regulation, thereby serving as a superior tool for both clinical research and basic physiological investigation. Through this work, we seek to establish a new standard for the analysis of time-varying physiological signals.

# Methods

## Model Formulation

We model the R–R interval (RRi) signal, observed at a discrete set of time points $\{t_i\}_{i=1}^N$, as a probabilistic process. The model decomposes the signal into a deterministic mean trajectory, $\mu(t_i)$, and a time-varying total standard deviation, $\sigma_{\text{total}}(t_i)$. This approach allows for a principled separation of the underlying physiological trends from the structured and unstructured components of heart rate variability. The complete observation model is defined by the Normal likelihood in @eq-full-likelihood.

$$
\mathrm{RRi}(t_i) \sim \mathcal{N}\big(\mu(t_i), \sigma_{\text{total}}(t_i)\big)
$${#eq-full-likelihood}

The core of the model lies in the detailed, mechanistic construction of the mean and standard deviation components. The mean trajectory, $\mu(t_i)$, is a superposition of a smoothly varying baseline and a synthesized structured signal, as shown in @eq-mean-model.

$$
\mu(t_i)
= \underbrace{\mathrm{RR}(t_i)}_{\substack{\text{Gross}\\\text{RRi Trend}}}
+
\underbrace{A(t_i) \cdot \sum_{j=1}^{J} p_j(t_i) \cdot S_j(t_i)}_{\substack{\text{Scaled Structured Variability}}}
$${#eq-mean-model}

Here, $\mathrm{RR}(t_i)$ represents the gross, underlying heart period trajectory. The structured variability component is synthesized from a set of spectral oscillators, $S_j(t_i)$, which represent activity in different physiological frequency bands ($j=1,2,3$ for VLF, LF, and HF, respectively). These oscillators are weighted by time-varying proportions, $p_j(t_i)$, and their overall magnitude is governed by a time-varying scaling amplitude, $A(t_i)$.

Crucially, the total variance is partitioned into two independent sources: the variance of the structured signal, which is explicitly modeled by a target dynamic trajectory $\mathrm{SDNN}(t_i)^2$, and the variance of a residual, unstructured noise process, $\sigma^2$. The total standard deviation is therefore defined as in @eq-sigma-total.

$$
\sigma_{\text{total}}(t_i) = \sqrt{\mathrm{SDNN}(t_i)^2 + \sigma^2}
$${#eq-sigma-total}

This formulation explicitly models the time dependency of all major components, obviating the need for traditional sliding-window decompositions. It facilitates a unified analysis that simultaneously captures phenomena in both the time and frequency domains.

### Baseline Heart Period: $\mathrm{RR}(t_i)$

The $\mathrm{RR}(t_i)$ component quantifies the gross, underlying variations in the mean R–R interval. These fluctuations arise from short-term physiological regulatory processes, including changes in metabolic and cardiovascular demand and shifts in tonic autonomic drive. To capture these dynamics, this component is parameterized using a flexible double-logistic function, which yields interpretable "onset" and "recovery" parameters. This function, shown in @eq-rri-baseline-model, is particularly well-suited for modeling physiological responses to a transient perturbation like exercise.

$$
\mathrm{RR}(t_i) =
\underbrace{\alpha_r}_{\substack{\text{Resting RRi}}}
-
\underbrace{\beta_r \cdot \mathcal{D}_{1}(t_i)}_{\substack{\text{Perturbation-induced}\\\text{RRi Drop}}}
+
\underbrace{c_r \beta_r \cdot \mathcal{D}_{2}(t_i)}_{\substack{\text{Post-perturbation}\\\text{RRi Recovery}}}
$${#eq-rri-baseline-model}

In this formulation, $\alpha_r$ represents the initial, stable heart period, interpretable as the baseline vagal tone. The parameter $\beta_r$ signifies the magnitude of the decline in RRi induced by the perturbation. The fractional recovery amplitude is denoted by $c_r$, where $c_r \in [0, 1)$ indicates a partial recovery and $c_r > 1$ indicates an overshoot. The dynamics are driven by two logistic transition functions, $\mathcal{D}_{1}(t_i)$ and $\mathcal{D}_{2}(t_i)$, defined in @eq-logistic-components.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{D}_{1}(t_i) &= \left(1+ e^{-\lambda (t_i - \tau)}\right)^{-1} \\
\mathcal{D}_{2}(t_i) &= \left(1+ e^{-\phi (t_i - \tau - \delta)}\right)^{-1}
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-logistic-components}

The shared timing parameters govern these transitions: $\tau$ is the inflection point (midpoint) of the initial decline, whose rate is controlled by $\lambda$. The second transition is offset from the first by a delay $\delta$, and its rate is governed by $\phi$. This specific formulation directly estimates physiologically salient time points and magnitudes, facilitating enhanced mechanistic interpretation and improved comparability across different experimental conditions.

### Decomposition of Variability: Target SDNN and Amplitude Inversion

A key innovation of this framework is the explicit decomposition of the signal's variability. We distinguish between the target magnitude of structured variability and the mechanism for synthesizing it.

#### Target Structured Variability: $\mathrm{SDNN}(t_i)$

We generalize the conventional, static notion of SDNN (the standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals) to a dynamic quantity, $\mathrm{SDNN}(t_i)$, which represents the target instantaneous standard deviation of the structured portion of the RRi signal. By modeling this trajectory directly, we can capture how the overall "strength" of autonomic modulation evolves over time. To maintain parsimony and interpretability, the $\mathrm{SDNN}(t_i)$ trajectory is modeled using the same double-logistic functional form as the baseline RRi, as defined in @eq-sdnn-model.

$$
\mathrm{SDNN}(t_i) =
\underbrace{\alpha_s}_{\substack{\text{Resting SDNN}}}
-
\underbrace{\beta_s \cdot \mathcal{D}_{1}(t_i)}_{\substack{\text{Perturbation-induced}\\\text{SDNN Drop}}}
+
\underbrace{c_s \beta_s \cdot \mathcal{D}_{2}(t_i)}_{\substack{\text{Post-perturbation}\\\text{SDNN Recovery}}}
$${#eq-sdnn-model}

Here, $\alpha_s$, $\beta_s$, and $c_s$ are analogous to their counterparts in the baseline model, representing the resting SDNN, the magnitude of its suppression, and its fractional recovery, respectively. This trajectory shares the same timing parameters ($\tau, \delta, \lambda, \phi$) as the mean RRi, enforcing the assumption that changes in the magnitude of variability are temporally coupled with changes in the mean heart period.

#### Deterministic Amplitude Inversion: $A(t_i)$

The model must ensure that the synthesized structured variability signal, let's call it $X(t_i) = A(t_i) \sum_{j=1}^J p_j(t_i) S_j(t_i)$, has a variance that is precisely equal to the target variance, $\mathrm{SDNN}(t_i)^2$, at every time point. This requires a deterministic calculation for the scaling amplitude, $A(t_i)$.

By construction, the spectral oscillator signals $S_j(t_i)$ are standardized to have zero mean and unit variance ($\mathrm{Var}[S_j(t_i)] = 1$). Assuming they are approximately uncorrelated (a reasonable assumption given their differing frequency content and random phases), the variance of their weighted sum is:

$$
\mathrm{Var}\left[\sum_{j=1}^J p_j(t_i) S_j(t_i)\right] \approx \sum_{j=1}^J p_j(t_i)^2 \mathrm{Var}[S_j(t_i)] = \sum_{j=1}^J p_j(t_i)^2
$$

The variance of the complete structured signal is then $\mathrm{Var}[X(t_i)] = A(t_i)^2 \sum_{j=1}^J p_j(t_i)^2$. To match our target, we set the standard deviation $\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}[X(t_i)]}$ equal to $\mathrm{SDNN}(t_i)$. Solving for $A(t_i)$ yields the critical inversion formula in @eq-amplitude-inversion.

$$
A(t_i) = \frac{\mathrm{SDNN}(t_i)}{\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^J p_j(t_i)^2}}
$${#eq-amplitude-inversion}

This inversion is essential. It decouples the modeling of the total magnitude of variability (governed by the $\mathrm{SDNN}(t_i)$ function) from the modeling of its spectral composition (governed by the proportions $p_j(t_i)$). This separation allows the model to learn, for example, whether a decrease in total HRV is due to a general suppression of autonomic outflow or a specific shift away from a high-power spectral band.

### Spectral Components

The spectral character of the structured variability is determined by the properties of the oscillator signals $S_j(t_i)$ and their time-varying weights $p_j(t_i)$.

#### Dynamic Frequency Band Proportions

The proportions $p_j(t_i)$ dictate how the total structured variance, $\mathrm{SDNN}(t_i)^2$, is allocated across the different frequency bands at each moment. These proportions must satisfy $p_j(t_i) \ge 0$ and $\sum_j p_j(t_i) = 1$ for all $t_i$. The model captures the evolution of these proportions as a smooth transition between two distinct spectral states: a baseline state ($\vec\pi_{\text{base}}$) and a perturbed state ($\vec\pi_{\text{pert}}$). The transition is orchestrated by a single master controller function, $C(t_i)$, as shown in the convex combination of @eq-pj-using-ct.

$$
\vec{p}(t_i) = (1 - C(t_i)) \cdot \vec\pi_{\text{base}} + C(t_i) \cdot \vec\pi_{\text{pert}}
$${#eq-pj-using-ct}

Here, $\vec\pi_{\text{base}}$ and $\vec\pi_{\text{pert}}$ are simplex vectors (their elements are non-negative and sum to one) that represent the characteristic spectral distributions at rest and during peak perturbation, respectively. The master controller, $C(t_i)$, is itself built from the same logistic building blocks, ensuring the spectral transition is synchronized with the primary physiological response, as defined in @eq-master-controller.

$$
C(t_i) = \mathcal{D}_{1}(t_i) \cdot \left(1 - c_c \cdot \mathcal{D}_{2}(t_i)\right)
$${#eq-master-controller}

This function naturally transitions from 0 (at baseline) towards 1 (during perturbation). The parameter $c_c$ allows for an incomplete spectral recovery, mirroring the flexibility of the mean and SDNN trajectories. This elegant formulation models complex spectral dynamics using only a few interpretable parameters.

#### Multi-Sine Spectral Oscillators

To create a realistic spectral texture rather than a simple periodic signal, each oscillator $S_j(t_i)$ is constructed as a superposition of $K_j$ distinct sinusoids within its designated frequency band. The un-normalized signal for band $j$, denoted $S'_j(t_i)$, is given by @eq-multi-sine-fun.

$$
S'_j(t_i) = \sum_{k=1}^{K_j} a_{j,k} \sin(2 \pi f_{j,k} t_i + \phi_{j,k})
$${#eq-multi-sine-fun}

The frequencies $f_{j,k}$ are pre-specified within the standard VLF, LF, and HF ranges, and the phases $\phi_{j,k}$ are treated as fixed data to ensure model identifiability. A critical feature is the structure of the amplitudes, $a_{j,k}$, which are not uniform but follow a power-law relationship with frequency, as shown in @eq-power-law-amp.

$$
a_{j,k} \propto f_{j,k}^{-b/2}
$${#eq-power-law-amp}

The single shared parameter $b$ is the spectral exponent. A value of $b=0$ corresponds to white noise (equal power at all frequencies within a band), while $b>0$ corresponds to pink or brown noise, where lower frequencies possess greater amplitude. This is a common characteristic of biological signals. The exponent is specified as $b/2$ because signal power is proportional to amplitude squared.

Finally, to fulfill the requirement that $\mathrm{Var}[S_j(t_i)] = 1$, the composite signal $S'_j(t_i)$ undergoes empirical standardization: its sample mean is subtracted, and the result is divided by its sample standard deviation to produce the final normalized oscillator signal, $S_j(t_i)$.

## Discussion

The generative model presented for R-R interval dynamics represents a substantial conceptual and methodological advancement in heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, explicitly addressing long-standing limitations within the field. Traditional approaches have consistently encountered an inherent compromise between temporal precision and frequency resolution in spectral techniques, alongside the predominantly descriptive nature of derived metrics that frequently obscure direct insight into underlying physiological mechanisms. Our novel parametric framework aims to transcend these limitations by providing a unified, time-varying representation of baseline heart period, overall variability amplitude, and spectral composition, thereby offering enhanced resolution, transparency, and clinical applicability. This integration into a single, comprehensive generative framework suggests a notable step towards overcoming these pervasive challenges.

A cornerstone of this model is its significant capacity to explicitly capture time-varying physiological processes. Unlike conventional fixed-window spectral analyses, which average activity over extended periods and thus inevitably blur transient autonomic events, our approach models each core component as a continuous function of time. The adoption of double-logistic functions for $\mathrm{RR}(t)$ and $\mathrm{SDNN}(t)$ allows for the precise characterization of dynamic changes, such as the onset and recovery kinetics observed during physiological challenges like exercise. This mathematical formulation enables the direct estimation of physiologically relevant indices, including surge onset times, peak amplitudes, and half-recovery durations, which are critical for understanding dynamic autonomic responses but are often obscured by aggregated metrics. For instance, the rapid vagal withdrawal or sympathetic surges occurring during orthostatic challenge or acute stressors, phenomena of substantial clinical relevance, may now be quantified without the analytical dilemma imposed by windowing techniques.

The model's innovative use of a two-stage stick-breaking decomposition for spectral proportions ($p_j(t)$) further distinguishes it from existing methodologies. This hierarchical approach intrinsically ensures that the proportional contributions of VLF, LF, and HF bands sum to unity at every time point, while simultaneously reducing the latent dimensionality of the system. By modeling the VLF proportion and then the HF-to-LF ratio within the remainder, the model accurately reflects an inherent biological hierarchy in autonomic control over heart rate variability. This contrasts with standard analytical practices that frequently reduce dynamic spectral information into aggregated, static indices like the LF/HF ratio, which can ambiguously represent genuine increases in one component, decreases in another, or simultaneous modulations of both. Our model, by contrast, provides instantaneous, interpretable estimates of each band's dynamic contribution, offering a clearer perspective into the evolving balance of autonomic nervous system activity.

The physiological interpretability of the model's parameters is a considerable advantage. Each parameter within the double-logistic and stick-breaking formulations directly corresponds to a specific aspect of autonomic regulation, such as baseline levels, magnitudes of change, and rates of onset and recovery. This level of direct mechanistic significance, transitioning from descriptive to mechanistic insights, is often less explicit in other advanced HRV analysis techniques, such as nonlinear measures or data-driven decompositions. While methods like entropy or fractal dimension quantify signal complexity, they do not directly map to specific autonomic pathways. Similarly, many machine learning models, despite their predictive power, often operate as opaque "black boxes" devoid of readily apparent mechanistic interpretability. Our generative framework, by contrast, provides a transparent mapping from statistical parameters to physiological constructs, potentially facilitating clearer mechanistic inference and enhancing inter-study comparability.

A crucial implication of this unified generative paradigm is its ability to circumvent the time-frequency trade-off, a persistent methodological challenge in HRV analysis. By explicitly representing each latent component as a continuous, time-varying function, the model estimates instantaneous band-specific power without recourse to arbitrary smoothing or the use of sliding windows, which can temporally blur or obscure rapid sympathetic or parasympathetic modulations. This capability is achieved through the continuous, parametric representation of each component, supporting a high-resolution characterization of autonomic events. This approach may be particularly valuable for detecting abrupt physiological shifts that are often critical for diagnosis and intervention. The model's capacity to deliver precise, transparent, and mechanistically grounded insights into autonomic cardiovascular regulation represents a notable advancement in the field.

Furthermore, the generative nature of our model offers distinct capabilities beyond mere analysis. It can simulate synthetic RRI trajectories under controlled autonomic scenarios, a feature valuable for rigorous power analyses, hypothesis testing, and educational demonstrations. This simulation capability also allows for a deeper understanding of how time-varying frequency band contributions manifest in the overall RRI signal. While these spectral variations might be subtle and not immediately apparent to the unaided eye in a raw RRI time series, their underlying presence is precisely what the model is designed to capture and elucidate. This model represents a promising advancement, aiming to accurately capture the intricate data generation process behind heart rate variability.

Beyond simulation, the model possesses the capability of estimating the temporal fluctuations of a real physiological signal by robustly mimicking its underlying spectral components. This dual capacity for both generation and estimation positions our model as a potentially valuable tool for advancing the understanding of autonomic cardiovascular regulation in both health and disease. In basic research, it could facilitate mechanistic investigations into autonomic regulation, enabling quantitative assessment of coupling between respiratory patterns and heart rate, or precise delineation of recovery kinetics following physical exertion. Clinically, it may offer refined biomarkers for conditions such as dysautonomia, heart failure, and stress-related disorders, thereby potentially enhancing both diagnostic sensitivity and prognostic specificity. For wearable technology and biofeedback applications, the model could support real-time monitoring of autonomic state, which may guide adaptive interventions tailored to instantaneous physiological need. In essence, this formalized, physiologically coherent generative model of HRV aims to reconcile temporal and spectral analysis within a single, interpretable framework. By embedding parametric latent drives for baseline heart period, variability amplitude, and spectral composition, it is anticipated to contribute significantly to HRV research, fostering a transition from descriptive heuristics towards a quantitatively precise science of autonomic cardiovascular dynamics.

### Limitations

Despite its significant advancements, the current generative model possesses certain limitations that warrant consideration. The primary limitation stems from its parametric nature, which relies on a predefined functional form for describing the temporal dynamics of baseline heart period, variability amplitude, and spectral proportions. While the double-logistic function offers considerable flexibility and physiological interpretability, it may not universally capture all conceivable patterns of autonomic modulation, particularly those exhibiting highly irregular or non-monotonic behavior not well approximated by sigmoidal curves. The model also assumes a fixed number of frequency bands and their approximate central frequencies, which might not account for individual variability in spectral composition or shifts in resonant frequencies under extreme physiological states. Furthermore, the current implementation does not explicitly model or differentiate between the precise neural pathways contributing to each frequency band, relying instead on the established physiological interpretation of VLF, LF, and HF components. The generalizability of the proposed parameterization may also be influenced by the specific population and experimental conditions under which the model is applied and validated.

### Future Research

Future research endeavors will focus on expanding the model's capabilities to address its current limitations and unlock further insights into autonomic regulation. One key direction involves exploring more flexible, non-parametric or semi-parametric extensions to the functional forms, allowing for a broader range of temporal dynamics to be accurately captured without sacrificing interpretability where possible. This could include incorporating basis functions or Gaussian processes to model more complex RRI trajectories and spectral shifts. Investigations into data-driven approaches for identifying optimal frequency band definitions and their potential time-varying characteristics are also warranted, moving beyond fixed ranges to account for individual physiological differences. Integrating biophysically detailed models of neural autonomic control into the generative framework represents another promising avenue, which could allow for the explicit modeling of efferent and afferent sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways, thereby providing a more granular understanding of the physiological origins of HRV. Furthermore, rigorous validation across diverse clinical populations and a wider array of physiological challenges is crucial to establish the model's robustness and clinical utility. Comparative studies against state-of-the-art non-linear and machine learning approaches will also be essential to quantitatively demonstrate the enhanced insights provided by our mechanistic, interpretable framework. Ultimately, the development of software tools facilitating the broad adoption and application of this generative model will be paramount for its integration into mainstream HRV research and clinical practice.
